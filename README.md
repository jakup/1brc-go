# The One Billion Row Challenge in Go

Just having some fun trying out [1BRC](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) using Golang.

_2024-02-28: I created a baseline implementation, it produced the correct output in 1m0.535s on my home workstation.  baseline java implementation took 2m6.798s for comparision._
